## 📜 Smart Contracts Architecture (Move-based)

### 1. Admin Module (`admin::access_control`)
**Purpose**: Central authority for managing roles and permissions via "AdminCap" (Admin Capability) objects.

**Key Functions**:
```move
public fun add_issuer(admin_cap: &AdminCap, issuer: address, metadata_uri: String, ctx: &mut TxContext);
public fun add_manager(admin_cap: &AdminCap, manager: address, metadata_uri: String, ctx: &mut TxContext);
public fun assign_manager(admin_cap: &AdminCap, manager: address, asset_id: ID, ctx: &mut TxContext);
public fun pause_marketplace(admin_cap: &AdminCap, marketplace: &mut Marketplace);
````

Features:
✅ Capability Management
✅ Manager Assignment
✅ Platform Controls
✅ Permission Validation

---

### 2. Marketplace Module (`marketplace::trading`)

**Purpose**: Facilitates asset listing and trading without taking custody of assets.

**Key Functions**:

```move
public entry fun list_asset(issuer_cap: &IssuerCap, asset: Asset, price: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext);
public entry fun buy_asset(listing: &mut Listing, payment: Coin<OCT>, ctx: &mut TxContext): Asset;
public entry fun delist_asset(listing: &mut Listing, ctx: &mut TxContext): Asset;
public fun all_listings(marketplace: &Marketplace): vector<ID>;
```

Features:
✅ No Asset Custody
✅ Native Object IDs
✅ OCT Accumulation
✅ Direct Object Transfers

---

### 3. PaymentSplitter Module (`distributor::revenue`)

**Purpose**: Automated rental income distribution to asset holders.

**Key Functions**:

```move
public entry fun submit_rental_payment(manager_cap: &ManagerCap, asset_id: ID, payment: Coin<OCT>, ctx: &mut TxContext);
public fun claim_revenue(share: &mut RevenueShare, ctx: &mut TxContext): Coin<OCT>;
public fun get_token_holders(asset_id: ID): vector<address>;
```

Features:
✅ Proportional Distribution
✅ Manager Controls
✅ Native Object Support
✅ Automatic Calculation
✅ On-Chain Audit Trail
